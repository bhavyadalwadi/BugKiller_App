-Super bugs should appear randomly and are larger than regular bugs. Super bugs
 take 4 clicks to kill. Super bugs are worth 10 points. There should be a special
 sound effect when killing a super bug. Only one super bug should appear on the
 screen at any one time. Super bugs should not appear more often than every 20
 seconds. Super bugs can move in a straight line or zig-zag (chosen randomly).
